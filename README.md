JIRA2Slack

This is a jira/slack integration workaround.

It consists of three parts.

First, it listens to jira webhooks on the given port and forwards them to the related user.

Second, it collects the daily worklogs and inform users/managers about of shortcomings.

Third it provides a web interface for runtime configuration.
